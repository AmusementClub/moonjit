LuaJIT
======

This is an integrtion fork of the original
[LuaJIT project](https://repo.or.cz/w/luajit-2.0.git) authored by Mike Pall
with the aim of providing a quicker paced and more inclusive development
workflow for LuaJIT.  The original README is preserved below for posterity.
This repo will attempt to remain in sync with developments in the original
LuaJIT but will allow space to innovate and fix bugs so as to provide
continuity for people interested in the project.

of contributors may be found via the git log and from the CONTRIBUTORS file in

Branches
--------

The original LuaJIT project had two supported versions in v2.0 and v2.1.  These
were tracked using three branches, master, v2.0 and v2.1, where master is used
for v2.0 bug fixes and v2.0 simply tracks master.  This is confusing and does
not allow space for new development, so this project has a slightly different
branch layout that helps unblock development and also track the original
LuaJIT.

This repo has the following main branches:

  * master: This is where new features and language support will land.  This may
  diverge from the original LuaJIT, although as the goal of this project
  suggests, attempts will be made to remain as compatible as possible.
  * v2.1: This remains a bug fix branch for this repository and will be regularly
  merged with the upstream v2.1 branch.
  * v2.0: This remains a bug fix branch that tracks the v2.0 branch upstream.

The upstream master branch currently only tracks the v2.0 branch (or vice
versa, we may never know!) so it is ignored.
